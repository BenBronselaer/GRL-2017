This repository contains the data and script needed to calculate ocean, atmospheric and land anthropogenic carbon storage 
for a given atmospheric pCO2 history. The methods utilizes impulse response functions to:
1. Calculate the carbon emissions needed to produce the observed atmospheric pCO2 history
2. Convolve the emissions history with the impulse response function for oceanic and land carbon to give the respective
carbon storage in these reservoirs.

The parameters for the impulse response functions are taken from Joos et. al. 2013

In Bronselaer et. al. 2017 (GRL), this technique is used to calculate the oceanic antropogenic carbon inventory in 2011 that
is due to a rise in atmospheric pCO2 prior to 1850.
